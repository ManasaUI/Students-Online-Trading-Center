<div id= "leftside"> <p style= "text-indent: 50px;">The "(UCM) Students Online Trading Center", an e-portal for the students of UCM which provides a platform for exchange of information on sharing the students' needs. The existing university email which is generally meant to communicate between university office and students is flooded with many mails from students which are considered as non-informative by many of the students. As observed, the replies to these emails are also populated to everyone thus increasing the number of unnecessary mails in the mailbox. In order to avoid the inconvenience caused by these emails and to facilitate the students to share their needs, a new online platform is to be developed where students can exchange the information.This online site will help the not only the current students to share the information but also it provides students to get information regarding ride sharing, reselling products, free books,second hand books,  .
